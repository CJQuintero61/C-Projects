# C-Projects
This is where all of my C++ projects will go as I am learning. This will include assignments
from my university classes as well as other code challenges I decided to make.
I made this hub of all my projects so I could build a portfolio of projects I've done
as well as to track my progess. As of writting this (10/9/2024) I am currently in
Data Structures and wanted to learn more outside of class and I wanted to really get into 
C++ to make my own projects sooner and outside of class. The Programming 1 and 2 files will be
a little different than what a total beginner might have done, but that is due to me going 
back to the stuff I learned earlier and doing more than what was required in class alone.
I also will be following projects from here: https://github.com/nragland37/cpp-projects 
as well as doing a lot of the coding challenges from the textbook we used in class
called "Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects" by Tony Gaddis 9th edition.
