This program allocates an array and then takes user input to make a "scores array"
that is filled with a students test scores. There is a function to sort the array
in ascending order, print it, find the average, and to drop the lowest score.
The only thing I didn't code that I could think of that I would have wanted to add is 
after sorting the array, the tests are not longer labled correctly.
For example, test 1 = 100, test 2 = 90, well after sorting the code treats it as
test 1 = 90, and test 2 = 100 so that the scores are numbered in ascending order
but the test numbering is not correct. Besides that, everything else in my tests 
worked well.
