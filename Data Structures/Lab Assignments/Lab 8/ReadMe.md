I wanted to post this lab here for future reference as this was a struggle 
and I felt the programs felt rewarding that I was able to finish them in the alloted time.
Both programs deal with recursion: the first was to test is a number was a power of 7 and
then reverse a string given a starting value and end value. The example for this was if 
the string is "hello" and the start value is 1 and end value is 3, the string would 
become "hlleo". If the start value is 0 and the end value is 1 less than the length,
the funciton should reverse the entire word. For the second program, we had to use our
linked list template from [Assignment 2], and check if a list of values was a 
palindrome. Example, 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 3 -> NULL is a palindrome but 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL is not. 
This lab did test my logical thinking and I am glad that I was able to solve this so it will be here.
